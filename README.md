# ANSYS-Sims
ANSYS simulations for Rocket Spinning Capstone Design
Leave old projects unmodified
Save all new work to New ANSYS SIMS

ONLY use models from the Solid Models folder. If the model you want to use isn't in there, put it in there.
Include the SolidWorks version and the IGES file if possible (IGES imports to ANSYS cleaner I've found)

Save all files in the proper location with a descriptive name.
Sample name: "dimension-of-simulation_flow-conditions_description-of-simulation-geometry_
